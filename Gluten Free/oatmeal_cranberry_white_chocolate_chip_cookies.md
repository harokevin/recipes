 - 3 cups old-fashioned rolled oats (gluten-free if needed)
 - 1 cup (2 sticks, 8 oz) butter, cut into cubes
 - 1 cup firmly packed brown sugar
 - 1/2 cup granulated sugar
 - 2 large eggs
 - 2 tsp vanilla paste or vanilla extract
 - 1-1/2 cups (180g) all-purpose flour, or gluten-free flour blend
 - 1 tsp baking soda
 - Pinch kosher salt
 - 2 tbsp water (or more vanilla if you want)
 - 1 cup white chocolate chips
 - 2 cups dried sweetened cranberries


#Direction:
- Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment or Silpats. Place the oats in a food processor and pulse several times to break them up slightly. Set aside.

- Brown the Butter: Place the butter in a heavy 2 or 3-quart saucepan with a light interior so you can see the color of the butter as it changes. Over medium heat melt the butter, swirling occasionally. It will foam up and then the foam will subside. Whisk or stir frequently to watch for the first signs of browning. The milk solids will begin to brown and the butter will begin to smell nutty; if you can’t see well, use the aroma as your guide. Watch carefully, it only takes a second for it to change from perfectly browned to burned and bitter. When you start to see browning, remove the pan from the heat. The residual heat will finish browning it. Pour into the bowl of your standing mixer and set aside to cool slightly.

- Make the Cookie Dough: Add both sugars to the melted butter and beat on medium high speed with the paddle attachment for about 3 minutes, until well blended. It will look a sandy and clumpy, and you can comfortably hold your hand on the bottom of the bowl. Turn off the mixer and scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as well as the beater blade(s). With the mixer on low, add the eggs and vanilla. Beat for three more minutes on medium speed until lightened in color and creamy.

- While the sugar and egg mixture is beating, in a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, and salt. Whisk until thoroughly combined.
Add half the flour mixture to the butter and egg mixture. Carefully beat it in, pulsing it initially, and then increasing the speed as the flour is incorporated. Scrape the bowl and beater(s). Add remaining flour mixture and beat just until there are no more white streaks and batter is smooth.

- Stir in water and beat until fully incorporated and smooth. Scrape the bowl and beater(s) again.

- Mix in the oatmeal. Stir in the white chocolate chips and the cranberries. You can make the dough to this point up to a day or two in advance and store, covered, in the refrigerator. Gluten-free doughs are often better when left overnight in the refrigerator, allowing the flours time to fully absorb all the moisture.

- Portion out heaping tablespoons of cookie dough using a spring-loaded ice cream scoop and place them about 2 inches apart. Press the tops to flatten slightly if you want crispy cookies and leave them rounded for softer, chewier cookies.
Bake the Cookies: Bake in the preheated oven for about 15 minutes or until they are golden brown and still soft in the center, spinning them halfway through.

- Take the cookies out of the oven and let them cool for two or three minutes on the baking sheet. They will firm up as they cool. Using a spatula, carefully transfer the cookies to a wire rack to cool. When completely cooled, store in an airtight container.

- Give to neighbors.

#Notes:
Yield: about 4 dozen 2-inch cookies
